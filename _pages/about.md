### <i class="fa fa-fw fa-cat" aria-hidden="true"></i> About me

**Maternity Leave:** In the Spring 2023 semester, I will be on maternity leave. I am still recruiting for [SCOPE lab](https://scopelabuta.github.io/) for the fall of 2023 but will not be teaching or taking on new students in the Spring 2023 semester.

I am an Assistant Professor of [Computer Science](https://www.uta.edu/academics/schools-colleges/engineering/academics/departments/cse) at [The University of Texas at Arlington](https://www.uta.edu/) (UTA), a member of the [Software Engineering Research Center (SERC)](https://se-research-center.uta.edu/) at UTA, the faculty advisor for UTA's [SWE](https://swe.org/) club and a member of the College of Engineering Arlington Women in Engineering organization (COE AWE). Here is my current [CV](/files/ASullivan_CV.pdf).

I am lead professor of [SCOPE lab](https://scopelabuta.github.io/) which focuses on improving techniques to **s**how the **c**orrectness **o**f all **p**rogram **e**xecutions.  You can explore our [projects](https://scopelabuta.github.io/projects/) and see the types of things SCOPE lab gets up too. **We are hiring!** See lab website for details.

I obtained my PhD in the Software Verification, Validation and Testing (SVVAT) group at the University of Texas at Austin (hook'em) in 2017. My adviser is [Sarfraz Khurshid](https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~khurshid/). I obtained my M.S. degree in software engineering at UT Austin in 2014 and my B.S. degree in software engineering from The University of Texas at Dallas in 2012 (whoosh). My PhD dissertation can be found [here](files/dissertation.pdf). 

### <i class="fa fa-fw fa-lightbulb" aria-hidden="true"></i> Research Interest
My main goal is to improve software reliability by focusing on:
  * **Automated Software Engineering:** Test/Oracle Generation, Automated Bug Localization and Repair, Regression Testing, and
Mutation Testing
  * **Formal Methods and Programming Languages:** Model Based Testing, First-Order Logic, Program Synthesis, Model
Checking and Symbolic Execution
 * **Upcoming Service:** FSE Demo 2023 (PC Member), SANER 2023 (PC Member), 2 NSF Panels.

  I love puzzles just as much as my cat likes laying out over all the puzzle pieces. In my downtime, I play video games: I have a weekly discord get together with all my close friends in Texas. I equally enjoy getting out of the house. Since I stopped running marathons, I've taken to hiking -- I have a goal to visit every national park in the United States. I am also eager to get out and explore the world -- I enjoy backpacking with my husband internationally.
