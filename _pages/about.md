### <i class="fa fa-fw fa-cat" aria-hidden="true"></i> About me
I am an Assistant Professor of [Computer Science](https://www.ncat.edu/coe/departments/cs/index.php) at [North Carolina A&T State University](https://www.ncat.edu/) (NC A&T). Here is my current [CV](/files/ASullivan_CV.pdf).

**Starting in the fall of 2020, I will be an assistant professor at The University of Texas at Arlington!** I am looking for motivated Ph.D. candidates interested in software testing, automated program repair/synthesis, and formal methods. Please reach out for an opportunity to join me at UTA, located in the Dallas area.

I obtained my PhD in the Software Verification, Validation and Testing (SVVAT) group at the University of Texas at Austin (hook'em) in 2017. My adviser is [Sarfraz Khurshid](https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~khurshid/). I obtained my M.S. degree in software engineering at UT Austin in 2014 and my B.S. degree in software engineering from The University of Texas at Dallas in 2012 (whoosh). My PhD dissertation can be found [here](files/dissertation.pdf). 

### <i class="fa fa-fw fa-lightbulb" aria-hidden="true"></i> Research Interest

  I love puzzles just as much as my cat likes laying out over all the puzzle pieces. In my downtime, I play video games: I have a weekly discord get together with all my close friends in Texas. I equally enjoy getting out of the house. Since I stopped running marathons, I've taken to hiking -- I have a goal to visit every national park in the United States. I am also eager to get out and explore the world -- I enjoy backpacking with my husband internationally.
