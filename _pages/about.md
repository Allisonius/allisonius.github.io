### <i class="fa fa-fw fa-cat" aria-hidden="true"></i> About me
I am an Assistant Professor of [Computer Science](https://www.uta.edu/academics/schools-colleges/engineering/academics/departments/cse) at [The University of Texas at Arlington](https://www.uta.edu/) (UTA) and the faculty advisor for UTA's [SWE](https://swe.org/) club. Here is my current [CV](/files/ASullivan_CV.pdf).

I obtained my PhD in the Software Verification, Validation and Testing (SVVAT) group at the University of Texas at Austin (hook'em) in 2017. My adviser is [Sarfraz Khurshid](https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~khurshid/). I obtained my M.S. degree in software engineering at UT Austin in 2014 and my B.S. degree in software engineering from The University of Texas at Dallas in 2012 (whoosh). My PhD dissertation can be found [here](files/dissertation.pdf). 

### <i class="fa fa-fw fa-lightbulb" aria-hidden="true"></i> Research Interest

  I love puzzles just as much as my cat likes laying out over all the puzzle pieces. In my downtime, I play video games: I have a weekly discord get together with all my close friends in Texas. I equally enjoy getting out of the house. Since I stopped running marathons, I've taken to hiking -- I have a goal to visit every national park in the United States. I am also eager to get out and explore the world -- I enjoy backpacking with my husband internationally.
