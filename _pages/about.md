### <i class="fa fa-fw fa-cat" aria-hidden="true"></i> About me

I am an Assistant Professor of [Computer Science](https://www.uta.edu/academics/schools-colleges/engineering/academics/departments/cse) and the Undergraduate Software Engineering Program Director at [The University of Texas at Arlington](https://www.uta.edu/) (UTA), a member of the [Software Engineering Research Center (SERC)](https://se-research-center.uta.edu/) at UTA and the faculty advisor for UTA's [SWE](https://swe.org/) club. I am a recipient of the NSF CAREER Award (2024), the UTA CSE department Rising Star Research Award (2024) and UTA College of Engineering Outstanding Early Career Faculty Award (2025). Here is my current [CV](/files/ASullivan_CV.pdf). 

I obtained my PhD in the Software Verification, Validation and Testing (SVVAT) group at the University of Texas at Austin (hook'em) in 2017. My adviser is [Sarfraz Khurshid](https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~khurshid/). I obtained my M.S. degree in software engineering at UT Austin in 2014 and my B.S. degree in software engineering from The University of Texas at Dallas in 2012 (whoosh). My PhD dissertation can be found [here](files/dissertation.pdf).

Currently, I am lead professor of [SCOPE lab](https://scopelabuta.github.io/) which focuses on improving techniques to **s**how the **c**orrectness **o**f all **p**rogram **e**xecutions.  You can explore our [projects](https://scopelabuta.github.io/projects/) and see the types of things SCOPE lab gets up too.

I was a speaker at [NSF's CISE Career Workshop 2024](https://www.cnsr.ictas.vt.edu/NSF-CISE-CAREER-Workshop-24/index.html) along with 3 other past CAREER NSF recipients - our talks, slides and an overleaf template are posted online. Best of luck to all future PIs applying for the CAREER NSF - I hope our experiences are helpful!! Please reach out if you have any questions with "NSF CAREER Inquiry" in the title.

  I love puzzles just as much as my cat likes laying out over all the puzzle pieces. In my downtime, I play video games: I have a weekly discord get together with all my close friends in Texas. I equally enjoy getting out of the house. Since I stopped running marathons, I've taken to hiking -- I have a goal to visit every national park in the United States. I am also eager to get out and explore the world -- I enjoy backpacking with my husband internationally.
