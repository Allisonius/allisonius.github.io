Here, I provide a highlight view of some current projects; for more information, please read some of my papers, or contact me directly.

### Tools

I am interested in applied research, and the efforts to transition research ideas into real tools to be used by the software development community.

  * **MuAlloy:** Mutation testing tool for Alloy
  * **AUnit Analyzer:** Extension to the Alloy Analyzer that provides support for AUnit (test creation, test execution, coverage).
  * **ASketch:** Tool to synthesize parts of an Alloy model using sketching.
  * **ARepair:** Tool for automated repair of Alloy models. The tool firsts perofmrs fault localization to narrow in on the buggy portion of the model, then uses synthesis techniques to fix the model.
  
### Research Projects

## AUnit: Testing Alloy Models
One way to help develop better software systems is to leverage software models. Software models can be used to clearly communicate to all stakeholders both the desired system as well as the environment it will be deployed in. However, the expected benefits of formal modeling and analysis are reduced quite a bit if the model itself is incorrect. Alloy, a first-order declarative language based on relations, is a well-known modeling language. AUnit introduces the first testing infrastructure for Alloy, namely: test case, test executuion and coverage. With this infrastructure in place, we can now explore the well-established imperative v&v techniques (automated test generation, fault localization, mutation testing, regression testing, etc). The goal is to provide a robust testing environment for Alloy, to help reduce to burden of developing correct models.
